How do you capture experience? The want to capture life or at least aspects of the worlds in which we live drives the work I create. From this practice, I document moments of harmony as well as pain and confusion. My undergraduate paintings draw significant stylistic inspiration from the work of naive (a native style of art) artists in Guatemala. The paintings seek to understand what it means to be a bicultural person growing up in the United States. They try to signal to parts of my own life to let them know theyâ€™re documented, written down, cataloged, and told.
