Ex-Voto Wall
This is a collection of paintings from my Undergraduate work. Inspired by the ancient practice of ex-voto creation. Traditional ex-votos are small compositions depicting scenes of divine intervention. They cover altar walls in churches, stacked sometimes haphazardly around and on top of each other: giving thanks for blessings received, ailments cured, loved ones returned, or a dangerous situation avoided.
While I did not grow up Catholic, the religion serves as a familial and cultural connection. There is also familiarity in giving thanks that connects both my mother and father’s sides of my life. The “ex-voto” scenes on this page give thanks to moments of intervention in my life. For moments of life and death as well as butterflies and sunshine.
