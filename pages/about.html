    Ana Nicktae Marroquin-Haslett
    Welcome to the site. My name is, well, written very large right above these words. You can call me Nicktae, or Ink Bug. I have a Bachelors Degree in Visual Arts with a focus in Studio Art, and for now, most of my artwork lives here.

    “Why is your nickname Ink Bug when there isn’t any ink art on this website?”

    Ink is what started my love of art. Markers and pens covered my arms throughout my life, simply because I was delighted by the way it looked. When I finally understood that in ink your mistakes are new beginnings rather than limits, my world changed. Every “mistake” you make with a pen gives you the opportunity to create something new, something unexpected.

    Art is how I communicate with the world; heartbreak and laughter make their way into some form of creation. In this way, my art is influenced by everything I experience. I’ll stitch my beloved foods and flowers, paint the patterns my own Spanish gets lost in, try to recreate the landscape of our ancestors and the sky that holds them. The way we live, have been taught to live, have been told to live manifests in everything we do, especially in our art.
